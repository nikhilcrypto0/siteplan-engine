# Behaviour changes

A characterization test (tests/manifest.py) pins what the engine produces today. It may change
only together with a normative replacement test and an entry here: what changed, why, the
evidence, and the test that now holds the behaviour. Newest first.

## 2026-10-02: P0 (contracts, baseline, leak guard)

- **Dhulapally's regression moves from a blind run to a pinned debug run.** The blind run cannot
  run: since a3136f7 (10-01) the engine refuses to guess where a road strip lies, and the survey
  marks none. Replacements: `test_dhulapally_blind_run_stops_and_asks_where_the_strip_lies`
  (normative), `test_the_debug_baseline_is_reproduced` (characterization, both stilt readings,
  pinned in fixtures/baseline/dhulapally-debug-2026-10-02/). Evidence: the 10-01 code; the
  architect has not yet located the strip.
- **"Stilt + 10 fails on the road" is no longer asserted as law.** The removed
  `test_dhulapally_from_the_survey_alone_finds_the_height_the_law_and_the_ground_allow` assumed
  the stilt counts toward the Table IV height, an open reading. Replacement:
  `test_dhulapally_60_ft_road_allows_30_m_of_rule_height_under_either_reading` (normative: 30 m;
  9 floors above the stilt if it counts, 10 if not). Evidence: the architect confirmed the 60 ft
  road and that "Stilt + 8" means one stilt plus eight floors (2026-10-02); neither settles the
  stilt's place in the Table IV height.
- **Acceptance is blind by default and refuses the firm's finished plan.** A debug profile, a
  value tagged FIRM_FINISHED_PLAN, or a finished drawing given as the survey now needs `--debug`
  (`mode="debug"`). `test_a_test_profile_sets_its_values_labels_them_and_leaves_the_rules_alone`
  runs in debug mode and checks the DEBUG RUN header. Replacements: tests/test_blind_guard.py
  (normative), `test_dhulapally_blind_run_refuses_the_firms_finished_plan`.
